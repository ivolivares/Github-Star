# Github-Star
A chrome extension to get information from stars in Github.

## Building

In the repo's base path simply run:

```sh
$ npm run release
# or
$ sudo sh ./release.sh
```

This will compile and compress the required CoffeeScript and CSS files under `./source` to the `./release` directory.

You must have npm (node.js's package manager) installed, which can be found in http://nodejs.org/
